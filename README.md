# deep_directory_viewer
The built-in Windows File Explorer doesn't always display all files in a directory, even when 'Show Hidden Files' is selected. Some files, whether system files or malware, deliberately stay hidden from detection. This app uncovers all files by recursively scanning any chosen directory. It provides a detailed insight of each file, including hashes.
